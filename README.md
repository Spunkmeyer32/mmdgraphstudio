# MMD Graph Studio

Graph Editing and Viewing Tool.

I searched the web for a Mindmap-Tool which allows Graphs with Subgraphs and multiple Dimensions, Filters and Views.
Since I could not find such a tool, I try to write my own.

Do you have any suggestions? Let me know.

See the Releases-Tab for an early Alpha version.
